## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **No automated media cleanup** - Old media files accumulate
2. **No rate limiting** - Users can spam messages
3. **No automated tests** - Manual testing required
4. **Session limit not enforced** - Could exceed 50 concurrent

### Future Improvements
1. Add Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
2. Implement WebSocket for live QR updates
3. Add message queuing for high volume
4. Implement proper error recovery
5. Add comprehensive logging
